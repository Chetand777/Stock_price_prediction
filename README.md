"#Problem Statement: The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression to forecast future stock prices for a given company. The model will analyze historical stock price data, along with relevant financial indicators and technical indicators, to make accurate predictions of the company's stock prices over a specified time horizon. Stock price prediction is a critical task in financial markets as it helps investors and traders make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stock positions. The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable and accurate model that can forecast stock prices for a particular company."
